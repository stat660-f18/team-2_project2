'Research Question: Who were the clients of this bank?'

;

title2
'Rationale: This would help to identify the client of this bank, helping to understand who would be the target clients.'

;

footnote1
'Bank users' demographic data such as age,job,marital,education,housing and loan are used to draw a whole picture of bank users.'

;

footnote2
'The average age of the bank users are 40 years old. Sixty-one percent of them are married and most of them (82.43%) don't have a loan.'

;

footnote3
'Based on the results, almost half(48%) of the bank users are admin and blue-collar.Besides, there are 16.4% of them are techinician.'

;

footnote4
'Thiry percent of the users have a university degree while 23% are in high school degree.'

;

footnote5
'According to the result, half of them(52.38%) have a house while almost another half(45.21%) don't.'

Methodology: Used proc freq to find the frequency of custmoer demographic
data, using the result to draw a picture of the customers of the bank.
Limitations: Since there are limited demographic variables in the dataset,
it would be better to include more attributes for more accurate results.
Follow-up Steps: Add more client demographic data into the data set or combine
with other data results of bank clients analysis.

title1
'Research Question: Would the age of bank users affect the campaign result?'

;

title2
'Rationale: Based on the analysis before, we noticed that the average age of the bank users are 40 years. This would help to find out what's the relationship between users'age and campaign result which could help to improve the campain performance.'

;

footnote1
'A logistic regression model was built to check how the age of users affect their decision of subscription.'

;

footnote2
'As user's age increase, it's more likely that the campaign would be successful but the probability is very small.'

footnote3
'Based on the result, a small p value indicate that user's age did affect their final decisions in the campaign even though the affectness is relatively small.'

;

*
Methodology: A logistic regression model is used to find out the relationship. 

Limitations:Since user's age is only one of the social and economic context 
attributes.This analysis result may not be enough to undersatand how would the 
social and economic context affect the marketing campaign.
Follow-up Steps:Include more user attributes in the model.

'Research Question:What's the relationship between previous campaign outcome and this campaign result?'

;

title2
'Rationale: This would help find out how the previous campaign outcome affected this campaign result, meanwhile, we are able to indentify who were the customer easily affected by campaigns.'
;

footnote1
'A logistic regression was built to check the relationship between outcome of the previous marketing campaign and the outcome of this marketing campaign.'

;

footnote2
'The results tells us if the outcome of previous marketing campaign was success, the outcome of this marketing is more likely to be success.'

;

footnote3
'There is a small p-value in the analysis result which tells us that this relationship is significant in reality.'

;
*
Methodology: Use PROC logistic to run the logistic regression to find out the
exact relationship and whether this is significant in reality.
Limitations: There are many'nonexistent' values in the data set.
This will effect the accurace of the result because of the poor data quality.
Follow-up Steps: Find out a propriate value instead of using 'nonexistent' value
